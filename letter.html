        <p>You're one of the most important person in my life, and I am so glad you're born. I hope God gives you all the happiness in life, although in tje past year God did bless you with that (me :P). But jokes aside, I am so grateful to have met you (like 5 times :') ). 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Now seriously jokes aside, what I really love about you is how creative you are, and your eagerness to try new things. Your enthusiasm and curiosity are sooo contagious, that it brings a breath of fresh air. Thank you for sharing yourself with me, knowing you was one of the best things that has happened. Your energy, smile, and ideas light (literally) up my world.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Even though you're now halfway to 50, remember, age is just a number... a really big number. Turning 25 is like fine wine – aged to perfection :P
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Happy Birthday Prakash. May your year be filled with joy, laughter!
        </p>

        <p>I love you so much <3</p>
